A very limited RDMS query builder library.

[![Package Version](https://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/queryb)](https://hex.pm/packages/queryb)
[![Hex Docs](https://img.shields.io/queryb/hex-docs-ffaff3)](https://hexdocs.pm/queryb/)

This library covers a very limited subset of SQL. Most applications and
libraries in need of a query builder should instead use [Cake](https://github.com/inoas/gleam-cake).
